= Talkyard Decisions

In this file: Decisions made when building Talkyard,
about how to do things, and how _Not_ do things.

Usage:

1) Before adding any 3rd party lib, e.g. `react-transition-group`, search this file
for the name of that lib, and related words, e.g. "animations".
Because maybe a decision was made to _Not_ use that lib
and do things in _other_ ways instead.
And it'd be annoying if these decisions got forgotten so that years later,
things got done in the bad ways.

2) Before making any non-trivial decision, search this file for related words,
and see if there're related thoughts and previous decisions here, already.



== Year 2020


=== Use Asciidoc for documentation

2020-05-16: Use Asciidoc for docs, not Markdown or CommonMark.

Why? See e.g.: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18848278:
_"I've entirely replaced markdown and been using asciidoctor
for both documentation and general writing.
Asciidoctor is far superior to Markdown [ ...]"_.
You can also websearch: "site:news.ycombinator.com markdown vs asciidoc".

As of 2020-05 most Ty docs are in Markdown. But don't add any more Markdown docs.
And some day, can run sth like:
`find . -type f -name '*.md' -exec pandoc -f markdown -t asciidoc {} \;`
to convert from .md to .adoc. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22875242


=== Use CSS animations

2020-05-16: Don't add `react-transition-group` or any other animations lib. `[REACTANIMS]`
Only use CSS anims in Ty for now.

CSS animations are simple and fast and keep the bundles small.
Others agree:
_"use it instead of importing javascript libraries, your bundle remains small.
And browser spends fewer resources"_
https://medium.com/@dmitrynozhenko/5-ways-to-animate-a-reactjs-app-in-2019-56eb9af6e3bf

_"ReactTransitionGroup has small size"_ they write, but:
`react-transition-group.min.js`  is 5,6K  min.js.gz (v4.4.1, May 2020)
— that's _too much_ for Talkyard! (at least for now, for slim-bundle).



=== Don't use Nodejs server side

Don't use Express (expressjs.com) or sth like that.
Hard to reason about security, e.g.: https://hackerone.com/reports/712065,
who could have guessed:

----
const _ = require('lodash');
.zipObjectDeep(['proto_.z'],[123])
_.zipObjectDeep(['a.b.__proto__.c'],[456])
console.log(z) // 123
console.log(c) // 456
----

Plus other vulns all the time in js libs it seems to me.
And 9999 microdependencies —> supply chain attacks made simple.
_"npm has more than 1.2M of public packages [...] perfect target for cybercriminals"_
writes https://snyk.io/blog/what-is-a-backdoor.
Look: is-odd and is-even: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16901188.

Using Javascript in the browser, though, is different —
as long as the browser talks only with the Ty server.

Also better not use Python or Ruby for server code.

SECURITY [to_ty_risky] to-talkyard is a bit risky: nodejs code that parses user defined data.
Use a different lang? Run in sandbox?



=== Vendor everything

Vendor all dependencies, i.e. bundle their source code (or at least
JARs) together with Talkyard.

Four reasons:

- Security. Can diff changes in vendored deps.
- Developer friendliness. Seems some people are behind company firewalls and proxy servers
  that break downloading some dependencies.
  But accessing Git seems to have worked for everyone.
- Continuous Integration. Then good if can build offline?
- Working offline. If the wifi stops working and your phone too (no tethering).

Place the vendored stuff in Git submodules.
Then, if the vendored stuff's Git repos eventually grows large because of old
historical commit objects,
those Git submodules can be squashed or sth like that, making them small again
— without affecting the history in the main repo (it'd just be updated to point to
the squashed stuff).



=== "Join" or "Sign Up" button title

What should the join community button title be?  `[join_or_signup]`

"Join", "Sign Up", "Create Account", "Register"?
_
- Not "Register" — sounds like the tax agency.
- Not "Create Account" — that's too long, causes UX trickiness on 400 px wide pohnes.
- Not "Sign up" because non-native non-native English speakers
  sometimes don't know the difference between "Sign Up" and "Sign In",
  or "Sign Up" and "Log In" (incl me, KajMagnus, long ago).
  (See e.g.: https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/24384/what-is-the-difference-among-sign-up-sign-in-and-log-in )

But "Join" is simple to understand? And short and sounds friendly? So "Join" it'll be.

Don't use "Sign in" for the login button title either, because can get confused
with "Sign up", and also, is 1 letter longer than "Log in".
Facebook uses "Log in" so "everyone" should be used to this.

So: "Join" and "Log in" and "Log out", in Talkyard.
